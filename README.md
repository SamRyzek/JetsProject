#Jets Project

## This project is the second major project of the BootCamp. This project marks the completion of the second week.

### Concepts utilized during this project:

1. TDD
2. Objects
3. Methods
4. Getters and Setters
5. Arrays
6. String Builder
7. Constructors
8. UML

### Overview

The basis for this project was a hangar that contains jet aircraft and a barracks that contains pilots. Aircraft are have characteristics that include model, speed (in Mach), range, and cost. Pilot's have a name, age, and experience level. Each aircraft is assigned, randomly, a pilot. The program menu has 7 options. Option 1: lists the aircraft fleet. Option 2: lists available pilots. Option 3: provides the fastest jet and will update when a jet is added. Option 4: the user can view the jet with the longest range. Option 5: the user can add a jet to the hangar. At the completion of adding the jet's information, the user will also be prompted to enter a new pilot's information as well. Option 6: gives the user the ability to add a stand-alone pilot. Option 7: gives the user the option to exit the program. 

### Challenges

This program offered many difficult challenges to address. However, the most difficult challenge was the adding of pilots and jets the their respective locations. The second biggest challenge was designing the program so that random pilots could assigned to different jets. With assistance, each of these challenges were addressed and both areas are heavy with comments to assist in future review.
